# Netlify redirects file for React Router (SPA)
# This tells Netlify to serve index.html for all routes that don't match static files
# This allows React Router to handle client-side routing

# Handle all routes by serving index.html (except for files that actually exist)
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (if you want to force HTTPS)
# http://royavalet.netlify.app/*    https://royavalet.netlify.app/:splat    301!

# Optional: Handle API routes if you have a backend (currently not needed since backend is separate)
# /api/*    https://your-backend-url.com/api/:splat    200
