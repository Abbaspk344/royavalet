          Swiss Valet Parking Services is going to introduce delivery bikers providing service to ease your headache of managing delivery. In this modern world, on time delivery has been the choice of your guest and you are committed to fulfill it. No matter how bad the traffic is, and weather burning the roads, everybody want their delivery on time. What festival? What birthday? Delivery Boy should stand at a doorstep to hand over a parcel to a delighted guest before he zips to the next address. We decided to create a plan and started paying for the hard work and dedication they put in their work. We pay our riders on the amount of work they do. Not only for the companies but also riders should be satisfied, this is our motto. We were sure about the idea and know it is going to be a win-win situation for both the companies.
